# Valheim Server Send/Receive Limit Patch - Docker

> ⚠️ **Use at your own peril, traveler.** This setup modifies Valheim's managed server binaries (`assembly_valheim.dll`) at runtime to raise the internal packet send/receive limit. It is **not officially supported by Iron Gate** and may break or require maintenance after future Valheim updates.

---

## 🛡️ Overview

This project extends the [lloesche/valheim-server](https://github.com/lloesche/valheim-server-docker) Docker image with an automated patcher that raises the server's internal **send/receive queue size** (default `10240 bytes`) to a higher configurable value, typically **30720 bytes**.  
This can reduce desyncs, rubber-banding, and “lag spikes” caused by Valheim's small network packet buffer.

## 📜 Notes from the Mead Hall

There are mods that exist that do very similar things, if not the same thing. You might consider those first.
Namely:

- https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/CW_Jesse/BetterNetworking_Valheim/
- https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/Smoothbrain/Network/

I opted to go this route so I could have full control the server files and their modifications. I prefer to not use mods on my servers if possible! (Mods are great!)

### What It Does

- Automatically builds and includes a small .NET console app (`ValheimNetPatcher`) that:
  - Scans Valheim's `assembly_valheim.dll` for constants equal to `10240` (the network send/receive limits).
  - Replaces those constants with your configured value (default `30720`).
- Runs the patcher automatically **after every game update** and **before** the server launches, using the base image's `PRE_START_HOOK`.
- Keeps SteamCMD auto-updates enabled — so the game still updates normally, and the patch is automatically re-applied afterward.
- Requires **no external mods or clients** — this is a _server-only_ runtime patch.
